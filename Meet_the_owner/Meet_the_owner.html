		<p>Hello my name is Ann Downie and I am the owner of cafe Villa 59. I have been in the catering business for the
	  	past 3 years, previously I had a cafe in South Queensferry. Before I went into catering I was a dental nurse for 15 years
	    working all over West Lothian, but I knew I needed a career change and I moved into catering. When you come to my
	  	cafe you will receive a very warm welcome and delicious food. My hopes for the future are to expand the cafe, taking on more staff and to be
	  	open for longer. I'm very much looking forward to seeing you here!</p>
